let's create a menu
•	the program should display all the options it has an then execute the option the user chose
•	each exercise should be in a new class which will be instantiated when its option is chosen and its method with the exercise executed
•	The menu should continue asking for option until the word exit is selected
•	Everything the exercise requires should be created inside the exercise class or method, example a new scanner
